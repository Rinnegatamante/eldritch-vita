In my research, I have learned of a \"Ritual of Binding\" which the mystics performed to contain the Old Ones the last time they threatened Earth.\n\nThe ritual of binding is performed by reading aloud the ancient words, which seals the invaders in an infinite prison spanning unknown dimensions; and then surrendering one person to serve as the eternal guardian of the prison.\n\nThe ritual may be augmented by lighting three candles.
